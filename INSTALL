To install Simplicity from scratch run the following commands:

./configure
make
sudo make install

The environment variable

$CPPFLAGS

can be used to specify additional include paths.

The environment variables

$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

or

$LDFLAGS

can be used to specify additional library paths.

If you add or remove files from the compiler and/or a standard library
run the following command when *everything has already been built*:

./autogen.sim

To make changes to the compiler or a library:

cd <your build directory>
export SIMLIBPATH=`pwd`
export SIMDATAPATH=`pwd`
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`

Attention:

make simple

builds the compiler from existing .c-files

To build the compiler from modified .sim-files make a copy of the current
compiler and use this copy to build the new compiler:

cp sim2c/simple sim2c/simple-orig
sim2c/simple-orig --static sim2c/simple.sim
