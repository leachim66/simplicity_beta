All C source code files generated by the Simplicity compiler inherit the license
from their Simplicity source code file (and not the license of the compiler).
So the bootstrap compiler's C files are licensed under the GPL (v2 or v3) and
the bootstrap library C files are licensed under the LGPL (v2 or v3).


The Simplicity compiler can therefor create programs that are licensed under any
propietary license (including commercial ones).


To create executable programs a C-compiler (e.g. gcc) is needed.
